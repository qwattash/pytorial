The set of operations you can perform on the object and its properties are determined by its _type_ (or _class_). The _class_ is the language construct that allows you to create custom types; however, we will dig into custom types later on, this section focuses on the basic built-in types in Python.\n",

This is a concept related to dynamic typing, where the _class_ of the object is less important than the methods (operations) it defines. We will address this when talking about classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the idea of a type, consider for example the number 10. It is an object and you can ask python its type using the `type()` function, which will tell you its type is `int`. As usual, the `help()` function will tell you something more about the `int` class, which is the class that describes all integer numbers."
