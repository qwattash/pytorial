    "- numbers\n",

    "- text\n",
    "- lists of things\n",
    "- complex structures (e.g. a person identity is composed of text for the name, numbers for age and date of birth)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, at the core, everything you deal with is an _object_. The _object_ is a piece of information with some associated operations you can perform on it. The set of operations you can perform on the object and its properties describe its _type_ (or _class_).\n",
    "For example, the number 10 is an integral number, so it makes sense to say that the number 10 is a specific instance of the class of integral numbers, which describes all possible integers.\n",
    "We say that 10 is an _instance_ of the integer _class_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has very important consequences on how the language is structured, so it is important to introduce the concept early on. We will progressively expand on the idea.\n",
    "For now the core ideas to recall informally are:\n",
    "- An _object_ is everything you can manipulate, generally it represents some data (e.g. a number).\n",
    "- A _variable_ is a label that you assign to objects to name and reference them in other operations\n",
    "- The _type_ or _class_ of an _object_ tells you _what_ your object is, and the _operations_ you can perform on it. \n",
    "For example, when I type `some_value = 10`, I create an object of type `int` with the value of 10, and give it the name `some_value`, so that I can refer to it later. The `int` type will define what I can do with it, for example the ability to use the four basic arithmetic operations with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in data types for most basic objects, and a way to build your own data types with custom behaviours (we will get to those later in the tutorial).\n",
    "Here we go through _what_ these data types represent, later we will learn how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a built-in python function `type()` that will tell you the type of something. You can use this in conjunction with `help()` as well!\n",
