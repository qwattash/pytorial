    "## Objects and Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, at the core, everything you deal with is an _object_. The _object_ is a piece of information with some associated operations you can perform on it. The set of operations you can perform on the object and its properties are determined by its _type_ (or _class_). The _class_ is the language construct that allows you to create custom types; however, we will dig into custom types later on, this section focuses on the basic built-in types in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, Python also has a more relaxed notion of data types, often referred to as _duck typing_ (this term comes from the saying “If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck”). This is a concept related to dynamic typing, where the _class_ of the object is less important than the methods (operations) it defines. We will address this when talking about classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the idea of a type, consider for example the number 10. It is an object and you can ask python its type using the `type()` function, which will tell you its type is `int`. As usual, the `help()` function will tell you something more about the `int` class, which is the class that describes all integer numbers."

    "- numbers\n",
    "- decimal numbers\n",

    "- collections of things\n",
    "- complex objects that represent something in your program (e.g. a person identity is composed of text for the name, numbers for age and date of birth)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a special type called the `NoneType`, which is the type of the special object `None`. This represents the absence of a value and is used as a placeholder or a return value when the absence of an object is not an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of _objects_ has very important consequences on how the language is structured, so it is important to introduce the concept early on. We will progressively expand on the idea.\n",
    "For now the core ideas to recall informally are:\n",
    "- An _object_ is everything you can manipulate, generally it represents some data (e.g. a number).\n",
    "- A _variable_ is a label that you assign to objects to name and reference them in other operations\n",
    "- The _type_ or _class_ of an _object_ tells you _what_ your object is, and the _operations_ you can perform on it. \n",
    "For example, when I type `some_value = 10`, I create an object of type `int` with the value of 10, and give it the name `some_value`, so that I can refer to it later. The `int` type will define what I can do with it, for example the ability to use the four basic arithmetic operations with it."
