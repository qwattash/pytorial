    "# Get Python\n",
    "[Python](python.org) is a programming language that is rather intuitive to write and is a very popular solution to automate the many prototyping and scripting tasks necessary for data analysis in various scientific fields.\n",
    "The popularity of python is certainly due, among other things, to the relative ease of use across platforms (e.g. Windows and Linux) and to the wide community support: there is a pyhton library for almost everything you can think of!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "*Where am I?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt limit the amount of magic we rely on, I will start from a minimal python setup so that we can see the very basic requirements for running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you need:**\n",
    "- A plain text editor\n",
    "- The python interpreter\n",
    "- A python package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "A python source file is just a text file, which usually is given the \".py\" extension. There are no special requirements to edit these files, in principle any plain text editor can do that."

    "  - Note that this will require ~3GB of disk space.\n",

    "  - This will need ~400MB of disk space.\n",
    "  - You will install later only what you need. Also give you the opportunity to practice with the *conda* package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation completes, you should be able to open a python interpreter by running:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python\n",
    "> print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "  Hello World\n",
    ">\n",
    "```\n",

    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",

    "Optional step: we create a separate environment for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda allows to create separate environments with different python versions and packages (note that this is also possible without anaconda, with the *virtualenv* package).\n",
    "Packages installed in an environment will not interfere with other environments, and help keeping your project dependencies under control.\n",
    "We now create the *pytorial* environment:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Create the environment\n",
    "conda create -n pytorial python\n",
    "# And make sure we switch to it\n",
    "conda activate pytorial\n",

    "[Jupyter](jupyter.org) notebooks are a handy way of mixing notes and code, in fact this tutorial is made of a set of Jupyter notebooks. This will be our editor, however feel free to explore other development enviroments, such as [Atom](atom.io), which are more well-suited for less interactive coding projects.\n",

    "Jupyter uses a specific default directory to look up notebooks, this usually defaults to your user's home directory (in whatever operating system you are using). You can either change that with the `--notebook-dir='path/to/my/notebook/directory'` option when you run jupyer or put the pytorial notebooks in the correct path.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** If you have [git](https://git-scm.com), you can clone this tutorial locally and run it in the same way. I am assuming that if you have git you know how to do that. I do not wish to explain source control software here as it would take another full tutorial to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assuming that you have a \"pytorial\" directory somewhere, you can run jupyter and open the intro page. You should get a browser window where you can select the pytorial chapters to open.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes in Jupyter are written in [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html), a fairly porwerful and intuitive markdown language, of course you can just write plain text but where is the fun?\n",
