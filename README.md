# A python tutorial
This is my first attempt at writing a python tutorial.
After a few years that I use python I found many great resources to learn
and people who shared their experience. There is certainly no lack of tutorials
on Python, my intention is to give back to the community and, in the process,
practice the art of teaching. Hopefully I will be able to write something that
ends up being useful to somebody.

Cheers!
